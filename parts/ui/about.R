        p("The overall aim of UNEPâ€™s Environmental Cooperation for Peacebuilding (ECP) programme is to strengthen the capacity of fragile States, regional organizations, UN entities and civil society to assess and understand the conflict risks and peacebuilding opportunities presented by natural resources and environment in order to formulate more effective response policies and programmes across the spectrum of peace and security operations. To achieve this goal, UNEP/ECP establishes an evidence base of good practices, co-manages a global knowledge platform and community of practice, conducts policy-relevant research with UN and other partners, and helps UN country teams and fragile states apply these policies and practices at the fiield level through technical support and catalytic partnerships.")),

        tags$p("Against this background, UNEP/ECP is partnering with the World Bank to explore the feasibility of co-developing an open access geo-mapping platform for extractive industries in fragile states (code named MAP-X). The platform would aim to consolidate all existing resource concession, land use, and risk information into a single open source system in order to provide transparent access to this information by all stakeholders, improve strategic decision making and enhance benefit sharing. As many fragile states contain important reserves of biodiversity, this system could also help improve the identification of environmentally sensitive areas, establish more effective impact mitigation measures, and enhance the environmental management capacity of the g+7 member states. This SSFA with UNIGE will contribute to this feasibility study for the geo-mapping platform.ii")
