White salts: 
Coordinates (in Lubumbashi): 11 40 59.6//027 28 07.5 
Caption: High concentrations of zinc salts at effluent discharge point. They are highly toxic to fish and aquatic life and chronic exposure may also create health problems. 


Tailing: 
Coordinates: we could not find the exact coordinates but it is from Kolwezi. So the photo can appear (near Kolwezi) together with the salts photos but it should not point to any specific location. 
Caption: In some cases tailings contain millions of tonnes of mining waste materials, with significant concentrations of copper, zinc and cobalt. They constantly release leached metals into surface waters, creating risk for humans and environment.   


TITLE: (for white salts) High concentrations of zinc salts at effluent discharge point, (for pink salts) High concentrations of heavy metals along river bed, (for tailings) A tailing in Kolwezi area.
