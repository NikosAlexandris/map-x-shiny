# Auto generated password

During provisioning, the script will generate random passwords and store them in plain text in /passwords/generated/

If a file with the corresponding ID already exists, the script will simply read from it. 

A good security measure should be to delete them after read.

If a new provisioning is done, if the passwords are removed, new passwords will be used
